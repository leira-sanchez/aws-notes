# What is Cloud Computing?

## Parts of a Server

1. CPU
1. RAM (memory)
1. Storage: Data
1. Database: Store data in a structured way
1. Network: routers, switch, DNS server

## Cloud Computing

On-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources. Pay as you go pricing.

## Types of Cloud Computing

1. Infrastructure as a Services (IaaS)
1. Platform as a Service (Paas)
1. Software as a Service (Saas)

## Pricing of the Cloud. Pay for:

1. Compute time
1. Data stored in the cloud
1. Data transfer **OUT** of the cloud

## AWS Regions

A cluster of data centers (Availability Zones)

## How to Choose AWS Regions:

1. Compliance
1. Proximity to customers
1. Available Services (not all services are available in all regions)
1. Pricing -> varies by region

## Availability Zones

- one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
- isolated from each other
- 2-6 per region, usually 3

## Shared Responsibility Model

- customer -> security **IN** the cloud
- AWS -> security **OF** the cloud
