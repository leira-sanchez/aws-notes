# S3 – Simple Storage Service

Allows you to store objects (files) in buckets (directories)

- Infinitely scaling storage
- Buckets must have a globally unique name
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- Looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- Naming convention

  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3-63 characters
  - not an IP
  - must start with lowercase letter or number

- Objects have a key

  - key – full path of the file. Composed of _prefix_ + [object name]

- There are no directories within buckets, just very long names with slashes

- Object values are the content of the body
- Max object size is 5TB
- Multi-part upload must be used for bigger objects
- Objects also have metadata, tags, version ID

## S3 Security

- User based – IAM policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM console

- Resource based

  - Bucket policies – bucket-wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account
  - Object Access Control List (ACL) – finer grain
  - Bucket Access Control List (ACL) – less common

- An IAM principal can access an S3 Object if:

  - the user's IAM permissions allow it

    **OR**

  - the resource policy allows it **AND** there's no explicit DENY.

- Encryption – encrypt objects in S3 using encryption keys

- Bucket policies

  1. JSON based
  1. Used to

     - Grant public access to the bucket
     - Force objects to be encrypted at upload
     - Grant access to another account (cross-account)

## S3 Websites

- S3 can host static websites and have them accesible on the www
- URL:

  `<bucketName>.s3-website.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com`

  **OR**

  `<bucketName>.s3-website-<aws-region>.amazonaws.com`

- A 403 could mean that the bucket policy doesn't allow public reads

## S3 Versioning

- Enabled at bucket level
- Same key overwrite will increment the version
- Benefits of versioning

  - Protect against unintended deletes (restore)
  - Easy rollback to previous version

- Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have `null`

- Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions
