# Simple Storage Service (S3)

* Object-based - allows you to upload files
    * Key - name of object/file

    * Value - the data

* Files size - 0 bytes to 5TB

* Unlimited storage

* Successful uploads return a HTTP 200 status code

## Buckets
* Buckets - a folder in the cloud where files are stored

* Universal namespace - bucket names must be unique globally

* Example URL: 
    
    `https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/uniquebucketname

* By default, buckets are private 

* Acces Control to buckets can be setup using:
    * Bucket policies - bucket-wide

    * Access Control Lists

* Sharing Buckets Across Acccount
    * Bucket Policies & IAM (applies to entire bucket). Programmatic access only.

    * Bucket ACLs & IAM (individual objects). Programmatic access only.

    * Cross-account IAM Roles. Programmatic and Console access.

* **Access Logs** - Log all requests made to the S3 bucket. It is possible to configure S3 buckets to create access logs that can be sent to another bucket even if it's in another account.

## Consistency Model
* Read after Write for PUTS of new objects

* Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES - takes more time than creating a new file

## Storage Classes

|Class| Availability| Durability| Comments|
|-----|------------|--|---|
|S3 Standard| 99.99%| 99.99999999%|Stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities. Designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently.|
| S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed) | 99.9%| 99.999999999% | For infrequently access data that still needs to be accessed quickly. Cheaper than S3 but there is also a retrieval fee.|
|S3 One Zone - IA| 99.50% | 99.999999999% | Lowest cost option for infrequently accessed data that doesn't require multiple AZ resilience.|
| S3 - Intelligent Tiering | 99.9% | - | Designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without impacting performance or operational overhead.|
|S3 Glacier| 99.99% | - | Secure, durable, low-cost storage class for data archiving. Default retrieval time takes hours but can be configured to take minutes at a cost.|
|S3 Glacier Deep Archive| 99.99%| - | Lowest-cost storage class where a retrieval time of 12 is acceptable.|

## Encryption 
### In Transit
* SSL/TLS 

### At Rest (Server-Side)
* S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3

* AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE - KMS

* Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys - SSE-C

* Client-Side Encryption is the acto fo encrypting data before sending it to Amazon S3.

## Cross Region Replication
* Versioning must be enabled on both the source and the destination buckets

* Files in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically

* All files updated after turning on cross region replication will be replicated automatically

* Delete markers are not replicated

* Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated

## Lifecycle Policies

* Automate moving your objects between the different storage tiers

* Can be used in conjunction with versioning

* Can be applied to current and previous versions

## CloudFront

* **Edge Location** - location where the content is cached. Different to an AZ
    * They are read and write

    * Objects are cached for the TTL (Time To Live)

    * Clearing cached objects will result in a charge

* **Origin** - Origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. Can be an S3 Bucket, an EC2 Instance, an ELB, or Route53

* **Distribution** - Name given to the CDN which consists of a collection of Edge Locations

* **Web Distribution** - Typically used for websites

* **RTMP** - Used for media streaming

* Secure Acces to Private Files
    * CloudFront Signed Cookies

    * Pre-Signed URLs

[Cheat Sheet](https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-amazon-cloudfront/)

## Snowball
* Disk that can be used to move data between a data center and AWS Cloud

* Can be imported into S3

* Can be used to move large amounts of data out of S3


## Storage Gateway
It is a physical or virtual appliance that can be used to cache S3 locally at a customer's site.

* File Gateway - for flat files stored directly on S3

* Volume Gateway 
    * Stored Volumes - Data is stored onsite and is asynchrounously backedup to S3

    * Cached Volumes - data is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached onsite

* Gateway Virtual Tape Library - used for backups and uses popular backup applications like NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veeam, etc.


## Athena
* Interactive query service

* Allows you to query data located in S3 using standard SQL

* Serverless

* Commonly used to analyse log data stored in S3

* Can be used to analyze Cost & Usage Reports uploaded in S3 buckets. 

## Macie
* Uses AI to analyze data in S3 and helps identify PII

* Can be used to analyse CloudTrail logs for suspicious API activity

* Includes Dashboards, Reports, and Alerting

* Great for PCI-DSS compliance and preventing ID theft
